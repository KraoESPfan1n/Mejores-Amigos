## 1. **acethefurry16** *(Ace_16)*
*(First and foremost)*  
Ace is the best friend I have ever had. He has helped me in difficult situations and is also a very kind person. Although he is nice, his greatest strength is his ability to support me in sensitive matters and always be present when I need him. Thank you for being the best!

## 2. **elianmoises** *(Pepito)*  
Pepito is also one of the best, holding the second place. He is a classmate with a great sense of humor and is always willing to help me in complicated situations. His company makes difficult days more bearable.

## 3. **theprobacon300** *(Auroralis Boreales)*  
Auroralis Boreales is a friend who speaks English, but he has still helped me in difficult situations. We have played a lot together, which has made me feel better when I needed it. His friendship is invaluable to me.

## 4. **mugiwaranobijusebas** *(Muichiro Tokito)*  
Muichiro Tokito is similar to Seba in many ways, but he stands out for not being very "pay-to-win" in the games we share. His honesty and loyalty make our friendship even more special.

## 5. **elyonnymasna** *(ElYonnyMasNa)*  
It was thanks to him that I can unleash my imagination and earn income. Additionally, he sometimes helps me with difficult matters. If it weren't for him, I would probably be worse off than I already am. His support has been crucial in my life.

## 6. **seba**  
Seba is a calm friend (good, although sometimes not) who sometimes helps me with gaming issues or simply plays with me. Although he doesn't stand out much, he always surprises me with many gifts that demonstrate his generosity (I don't have to give him anything in return).
